**What does Soda SQL do?**

Soda SQL allows you to

 * Stop your pipeline when bad data is detected
 * Extract metrics and column profiles through super efficient SQL
 * Full control over metrics and queries through declarative config files

**Why Soda SQL?**

To protect against silent data issues for the consumers of your data,
it's best-practice to profile and test your data:

 * as it lands in your warehouse,
 * after every important data processing step
 * right before consumption.

This way you will prevent delivery of bad data to downstream consumers.
You will spend less time firefighting and gain a better reputation.
